# üê∂ End-to-end Multi-class Dog Breed Classification

This notebook builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.x and TensorFlow Hub.

## 1. Problem

Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.

When I'm sitting at the cafe and I take a photo of a dog, I want to know what breed of dog it is.

## 2. Data

The data we're using is from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition.

## 3. Evaluation

The evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image.

## 4. Features

Some information about the data:
* We're dealing with images (unstructured data) so it's probably best we use deep learning/transfer learning.
* There are 120 breeds of dogs (this means there are 120 different classes).
* There are around 10,000+ images in the training set (these images have labels).
* There are around 10,000+ images in the test set (these images have no labels, because we'll want to predict them). 

# Unstructured Data

Unstructed data is data you'll find outside of the traditional row and column structure (such as in an Excel spreadsheet or pandas DataFrame). Examples of unstructured data include images, audio and natural language.

If you're working with these kinds of data sources, it's generally best to use deep learning, neural networks or transfer learning to gain insights out of them.
